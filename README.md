This is an assignment given to us where we had to create an API for a fictional education company. I decided to do it code-first and used entity framework to migrate and create an SQL-database for me. There are one course table, one user table, one difficulty table and one usercorse junction table.

The idea is that the API wil be used for the education companys website. You will be able to create new courses, edit courses aswell as delete courses. Users will be able to register an account and then buy courses. The usercourse table will be used to track which courses a user has bought.
